    "Let's start with a question: **\"Why do we care about performance estimates at all?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"1.1\"></a>**Generalization performance** - We want to estimate the predictive performance of our model on future (unseen) data.\n",
    "- Ideally, the estimated performance of a model tells how well it performs on unseen data – making predictions on future data is often the main problem we want to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"1.2\"></a>**Model selection** - We want to increase the predictive performance by tweaking the learning algorithm and selecting the best performing model from a given hypothesis space.\n",
    "- Typically, machine learning involves a lot of experimentation. Running a learning algorithm over a training dataset with different hyperparameter settings and different features will result in different models. Since we are typically interested in selecting the best-performing model from this set, we need to find a way to estimate their respective performances in order to rank them against each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"1.3\"></a>**Algorithm selection** - We want to compare different ML algorithms, selecting the best-performing one.\n",
    "- We are usually not only experimenting with the one single algorithm that we think would be the “best solution” under the given circumstances. More often than not, we want to compare different algorithms to each other, oftentimes in terms of predictive and computational performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these three sub-tasks have all in common that we want to estimate the performance of a model, they all require different approaches. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will focus on **supervised learning**, a subcategory of machine learning where our target values are known in our available dataset. Although many concepts also apply to regression analysis, we will focus on **classification**, the assignment of categorical target labels to the samples.\n",
