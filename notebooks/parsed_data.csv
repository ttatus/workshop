4,"A charming and loving throwback to the kids movies of the 80's that didn't needlessly pander to their audience. Although the boy-and-his-beast framework formula has been done to deat, the actual concept is fresh and fun."
2,Well my daughter liked it. Has some funny bits. 3 stars
1.5,there's better ways to spend time. it feels like it's a kids film. ie written and acted by.. NOT for.
1,"Truly awful movie from the acting to the action to the CGI to the story this movie sucks, but that creature sure is cute."
3.5,I I would say that monster trucks very predictable about almost every thing that happened in the movie
1,Horrible and boring and bad acting
3,Funny movie for the kid in yourself. Also a good test to know if you are or not yet a full grown bitter adult.
5,Great movie for all. Good graphics and clean. Need more movies like this.
3.5,alien type et film... enjoyable
5,Very good movie for kids .
5,"Funny, cute, and filled with excitement"
4.5,"I enjoyed the film far more than I expected. Funny, cute and heartwarming."
4,Cute kid's movie!! My 7 year old daughter loved it n I enjoyed it.
3,didn't think I'd like this as much as I did.
3,"Dodge Ram... all around the picture, that was better than story ??"
5,Excellent film where are the oscar waithingâ< for the second part congratulates the actors for their work
5,this movie looks cool
4,loved it the visuals were awesome!!!!
2,kids liked it. adults can tolerate it.
2.5,"The target audience is obvious here, but I liked it for what it was. There is nothing particular special about it. But as a cartoony Saturday matinee flick, I didn't mind it as much. Grade: C+"
4,"Overall a refreshing formulae for a family film. Understand view point of critics but as Father of 12, 9 and 8 year old, really good fun with something for ALL members of a family like ours. Not too highbrow, or artsy or action, but ENOUGH plot, animation and photography for everyone."
3,"It's stupid, but the target audience will likely get a kick out of it (and it's a lot shorter than the similar themed Transformers films). C+"
5,Great movie for kids. Loved the concept and music!
3,"Monster Trucks is one of those movies that's hardly great but far from bad. It will be mocked in some circles, loved in others, but one cannot deny its heart, good nature, well-meaning narrative, and agreeable characters. Yet one cannot deny its generic story supports and streamlined narrative content. On the whole, it's favorable cinema fodder; a movie that wasn't really ""necessary"" at any level, but one that should please its target audience and leave adults at least satisfied that it tried while making clear that it has its heart in the right place."
4,"Our family really enjoyed this movie! I'm not sure what all the negative hype is all about regarding the concept of Monster Trucks.. I thought it was charming, energetic, and funny.."
4,"Great movie it was entertaining as it should be, different yes and why not"
2,"Bad acting, nothing feels authentic and from half of the movie until the end, it's a downhill to Boring's Creek and Uninteresting Hill."
3,"It's weird seeing the new MacGyver playing this role, it was a fun movie to watch."
3,people really love cars
0.5,This is one dom movie i did not have the nerves to finish it so in stead rained it half a star
4,"Surprisingly, I THOROUGHLY enjoyed it... It was both funny and action-packed."
3.5,"Great children movie, thrilling chase scenes, cute creature that's a combination of a dolphin and an octopus within a moral plot. Sequels not be too far off if box office is good!"
1,Just for kids Under 12.
2,This could have been a great plot. But it went stereotype story where Lead actors try to save the creature.
2,"A movie that is for younger audience,story and characters not that interesting really .the more you watch the less you became interested in movie .The story is so simple in 20 min of a movie ,you will get the whole point of the movie overall a non interesting movie ,with bad lines and poore comedy and less action"
3,not the greatest movie but the kids liked it a lot
3,"Not exactly what I thought it was going to be, but my kids loved it"
5,It's an awesome movie:):)!!!!!!!!!
1,"Monster Trucks is ongeveer even amusant als kiespijn, met een slecht geschreven script vol met onnozele personages die je liever vermorzelt ziet worden door de wezens in dit verhaal. Zelfs kinderen zullen weinig plezier hier aan beleven."
0.5,Seems like there are running out of ideas and out came the idea of a sea Monster controlling a truck. Right.... Way too strange and the whole movie was just quite a mess.
5,"I really enjoyed this movie. Plenty of people claim that is was not that good, but I'd argue otherwise. This movie had adventure, action, and friendship all tied up with a sweet monster. This movie was actually pretty good, and I really enjoyed it."
4,good movie for the family. Nice graphics on the monster.
2.5,A decent movie at best. Rent it at home!
4,Great and interesting plot!!! Something that hasn't been done before and that's what makes it great for me!!!
3.5,ð??®ð??³+ð???ð???ð???ð???
4.5,My nephews loved this movie! I thought it was incredibly cute!
5,best movie ever filmed...trucks!! monsters!! what could go wrong
0,"Lucas Till can be a good actor, but this isn't the film to debut in."
1,"This movies isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is so freaking stupid. It lacks great acting, & there's a lot of silly moments in the screenplay. So, I would only recommend if your child wants to see it. Other than that I say give this one a pass. (3/10, F)"
3,Divertido. O monstro é super carismático e as crianças se divertem do começo ao fim.
5,Quality movie. Best movie of 2017
2.5,I like to watch this movie
5,This was fun and everything it promises to be a family friendly movie my son and I loved it.
5,I want to see this movie
0.5,"Just slap the guy from the ""MacGyver"" show in the film, put in a half-assed idea that involves in an alien, make the U.S. government look like the bad guys? again, & boom! We got a forgetful children's movie."
5,"Fuck yah! Monster trucks are life! I love my truck, I call her the Big Balls of Death! Fuckkkk yah!!! I love my dog Greta, she is so cute!"
5,My husband and younger female cousin went with me to see this. We all enjoyed it. I don't understand why some didn't care for it? Great family movie. Good for boys n girls to enjoy.
3.5,Fun silly family movie with alien monsters who power trucks by hiding in their engines.
5,kids loved it..real cute
3,"It tries to pack in a lot of story lines. Hence, the scene setting drags. Once the action starts, it is good fun. Boy gets truck: girl gets boy."
5,Great funny movie for the family
4,good movie my kid 7 loved loved it
5,What a fun movie. Far better than Lego Batman. The critics have this one completely wrong.
4,Awesome action and adventure! Great kids movie!!
4,Good Family movie...
5,Such a cute movie! I don't get the low ratings.
1,It's looks like crap had a baby said go make a movie
4,When the head of the film company approaches his son for a film idea. Well not bad for a kids script!!!
5,good kid family movie
4,"This is a kids movie. Young kids, 12 and under will love it. If you keep that in mind, it's decent. If you expect anything more than that, you're making a huge mistake."
4,It was a fun movie for kids don't overthink it
4,very cute family oriented movie
0.5,Bad concept and bad execution tarnish this hybrid family-friendly film.
3.5,a okay movie it has great ending
0,I want to see how Lucas Till will do without the X- man because he was a Star as Havak and I really like the actor hope he does good.
5,It's actually really cool and super cute! Loved it!
4,Monster Trucks was a good movie and awesome I loved it.
4.5,"I was so surprised by this movie. It was ""Different"" and adorable. It was quirky, fun, funny and heartwarming. I don't understand today's Critics, they won't know a good movie if you hit them over the head with it. All the kids, I mean all the kids in the theater were clapping a cheering for the Monster Truck, It was good to see a clean cut, entertaining movie."

4,"this movie did exactly what it is supposed to do...made me laugh-a LOT. sure, the hallmark of good sci-fi is that the science is basically believable. the science here isn't really believable, i mean, sure they could find species they don't know exist, but this type? nah that part doesn't exist. but i laughed through the whole movie and it had an all star cast of people i've loved in other things. Lucas Till (Havok from the X-men!) and Jason O'Mara (Agents of Shield!) then Rob Lowe (all those 80s movies and the West Wing) and Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon!) just to name a few. So this show won't win any oscars, but it's great for laughter. In fact, it's got a nice story of a kid bonding with an animal and learning to appreciate what he does have and a girl realizing not to judge kids she doesn't even know because she doesn't know what all they're dealing with. I appreciated the twist at the end with the step father not being a jerky loser because sometimes you find relationships that haven't been smooth are worth saving and movies that aren't going to win awards are worth seeing."
2,story was ok acting good had a great cast it was a fun movie not boring
3.5,"This film is not as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. It's not Oscar material, sure, but the story is nice and basic, perfect for children. If you are a fan of trucks in general, you just might get a kick out of it too. Is it good? It depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for something that is serious and realistic, this is not for you. If you're looking for a nice, basic story with a lot of action and cool vehicles and monsters, then this is worth seeing at least once. I personally had fun with it."
5,"Not sure which movie the critics saw, but my 5yr old boy, 7yr old girl, and I loved it. It was full of adventure and had its share of humor. Definitely recommend."
2,"'Monster Trucks' is a flat, misguided, laughable, vaguely likable film that isn't going to be appreciated anytime soon, but doesn't deserve to be venomously hated either."
3.5,"definitely geared for guys, as cute movie with an age old formula."
2.5,"No es demasiado buena, no tiene mucha logica, pero se deja ver y entretiene. A mi hijo le ha gustado bastante"
4,It's a cute little movie! I really enjoyed it. My 4 year old was a little bored because the story was so good and for him but that's why I liked it. It taught that monsters are sweet animals.
4,"This was WAY more entertaining than I was expecting. Yes, it definitely has its problems (awful main character, wooden acting) but what it set out to do - entertain little children - it does extremely well. My kids LOVED it! I mean, c'mon - it has monsters AND trucks... combined. How could kids NOT enjoy that? (It has the guy who played Lt. Dangles from Reno 911; he gets some big laughs. Also, it has the single funniest use of the Wilhelm scream that I've ever seen. I was rolling!) This movie is a great example of critics missing the mark. It's a shame that many of them lack the empathy it takes to understand how a movie's actual target audience would view a film."
3.5,it wasn't too bad it wasn't a bad movie it just wasn't a great movie
0.5,when a 7 year old calls a movie stupid you know just how bad this kids movie is.
5,I think this movie was great and any audience would enjoy it!
3,"Lucas Till who looks like he's 30 plays a high school student that rides the short bus to school.I decided to see MONSTER TRUCKS out of morbid curiosity. Between the trainwreck of a production and the fact this movie was supposed to originally come out in Summer 2015; I couldn't help but want to see the final product. All things considered this movie truly isn't that bad and I liked it to a degree. There are plenty of issues, such as the opening line of my review. It's not even necessary to have him be a high schooler, the fact he's in high school is literally touched upon for about a total of 30 seconds. The script is weak and a lot of the dialogue is lame.Surprisingly enough this film is pretty competently made. Visually, it's actually quite impressive. The special effects are pretty decent. I mean the 125 million budget had to go into something, right? The CGI monsters look fine. The action sequences are fun. Lucas Till and my future wife Jane Levy both give good enough performances.My biggest problem with the movie is that Till's character is a total dick to Jane Levy's character for about 70% of the movie. HOW COULD ANYONE BE MEAN TO JANE LEVY!? SHE'S A SWEET HEART! So yeah the movie's biggest problem is the writing.Despite all the production issues this movie had the final production is actually ok/fine, which is pretty amazing all things considered. MONSTER TRUCKS is a corny kids movie that I couldn't help but to somewhat enjoy. Or maybe I'm just crazy, that could be it too."
2.5,"Monster Trucks is not awful, it's just emotionless and poorly acted."
4,"A fun-filled adventure with a fun story. However, seems like any other Nickelodeon movie."
5,fun feel good movie. plus I loved the creature design.
2,ummm nonothing about this movie workedmight be good enough for pre teens with all the sillynessbut could scare anyone under the age of 6.i couldn't even tell you what the plot was about nor the car chase at the end. wait for cable. don't waste your time
1,Nick Now Is Off My Intrests. THIS WAS GARBAGE UGH! This is so bad I hate the story! Omg this is embarashing.
5,"Monster Trucks was interestingly loosely relevant to the Dakota Access Pipeline squabble of 2016/2017 yet whimsical enough to feel delightfully unreal. With humor, occasional romance and relationshipal sound bites that will get some to reassess how they interact with one another in their everyday pursuit of happiness Monster Trucks hits it out of the park and is even a great napping movie for the recently retired grandparents.Katherine WhiteGhostWriter Titanic (1997 Film)(& various other works)"
2,Painfully Average movie :/ why did I even watch it.Movie for kids I guess.
3.5,cuter than I expected. my kid liked it so thats all that matters. she is 10.
3,"So far this is my guilty pleasure of 2017. It's cliched, been done, with such a silly idea, It's hard to believe that a movie like this could be made. Despite that, I think the two main characters have a familiar but still likable chemistry, and I did enjoy this crappy movie overall."
3.5,"""Monster Trucks"" is a wonderful film for you and your kids. It delivers a great commentary on greed, acceptance, the environment, and friendship while also being fun, whimsical and in some cases exhilarating AND exciting! Now, looking at the technical aspects of it, the film displays FANTASTIC CGI, AMAZING Acting, And a GORGEOUS Script and Screenplay! (Bonus points for the unnecessary amount of detail put into the background!) However, the film does have quite the list of flaws. these include: The Side-story of Trip looking for his father only being explored for about 10% of the film (Oh, and by the way, when Trip talks to him for the first time the father doesn't show any emotional reaction or deliver a touching monologue, instead, the father acts like he has already met Trip, which he hasn't, and invites them to his mobile home for a short chat that lasts about 30 seconds only to reveal that his father sold him out. I'm serious.) before being abandoned never explored again. The next on the list is that the film, although suitable for all ages, has an extremely dark theme. That theme in question is that they're going to POISON the nest of creatures and then harvest the oil from the nest once they're all dead. Dafuq? Anyway, we have more mistakes on the list to cover. The next is the terrible acting that Chris wedge delivers. It's so clunky and exaggerated and just overall bad. Anyway, thats Monster Trucks."
4,"I went into it not expecting much based on reviews and surprisingly I found it very interesting, cheesy at times but I enjoyed it."
4,For its purpose of greatly entertaining young kids and giving a little something to the parents the film accomplished those goals!
4.5,Was a good family movie... the kids loved it and even us adults enjoyed it. A must see for the family.
3.5,"A nice, simple fun kids movie that actually got me invested. Sure there are a few problems here and there but it's harmless. I won't be surprised if the DVD sales of this are good."
2.5,"Your kid will most likely be entertained by this movie, but as for yourself, it will be boring, but not really anything repulsive."
3.5,"You can't not atleast enjoy this a little very original idea and great casting, my son loved it, trying to find the figures now"
4,"This is a great movie geared to kids. It is not perfect, but expecting nuance in a movie about trucks with monsters in them is ridiculous. This is a fun and original concept that is great for spending time with the kids. Everything you need to know is on display on the movie. There is not enough of this out there, and these types of productions need support. The conversation with my son after was more about what if than what happened (i.e. Rogue One; great movie, but I had to explain alot to him about the lore and tie-ins.) Monster Trucks may not be much more than what the title promises, but that is what makes it great. Watch the movie, eat your popcorn, and enjoy time with your kids."
4,It was a good kids movie. Very entertaining for my 5 year old and 10 year old.
5,"We saw this with our 9 year old twins , it had terrible reviews but they really wanted to see it so we went anyways. It was actually pretty enjoyable, and Danny Glover has a role in the film. Kids will love it. Kind of a neat story. The stepdad ends up being a good guy , we both commented that was the first movie to show stepdad as a good guy and real dad as a dipship."
2,"It's reward season and I wanted to see Moonlight, Lion, 20th Century Woman or Fences but Kids so Monster Trucks! When I was explaining it to someone Mike reminded me ""they aren't aliens!"" Sorry Mike."
5,That movie was awesome cannot believe how it turns out if you could give it a eight stars. I would.
5,It encompasses everything my son loves! Such a great movie for a family without being a cartoon.
0.5,"As you can see by the Name, Picture, or trailers this movie was was gonna be fucking awful and it was I don't even need to explain why you should already know why its fucking bad especially being on the shelf since 2014 and Paramount already know this movie was bad and it bombingLucas Till (he left X-Men for this shit) and Jane Levy should feel embarrassed for being I'm itOverall Grade: F-"
4,absolutely adorable! not to mention ram trucks everywhere!!
5,This was a great imaginative feel good movie!!
3.5,(From a kid's perspective)
5,"This was a great movie to take the kids to see! I'm not sure why the critics crushed it, this movie contained everything that little boys love and I was riveted to the screen as well."
5,"Screw the critics. This movie is obviously aimed to kids who love monster trucks. My kids loved it, that's the whole point of the movie - go have a good time with your kids."
1,"A predictable story filled with cliche moments that abrupt ends. The lackluster story forgot to explain many things in the story. The CGI was either unrealistically done or is really ugly-looking. In the end, Monster Trucks was a bad movie."
2,"The Monster Trucks movie is up against some big hitters. Animations like Moana, Sing, and Trolls are pretty popular, and I wondered if it would be hard for the partly CGI'd movie to hold it's own. I went along to the family screening at Hoyts at the Entertainment Quarter, and the place was crawling with hyped up kids who were all pumped to meet Creech on the big screen. I was there for the ride with my superstar junior reporter eight-year-old Emir Yasemin and his parents.How Will The Adults Find The Monster Trucks Movie?Let's be honest, this movie is not for us, but kids movies these days do tend to add the odd secret adult joke in there for us, just to keep it bearable and add some light relief. This is missing from the Monster Trucks movie, which was a shame. There are glaring potholes and cheesy lines abound, and it seems to have taken bits from ET, Gremlins, and The Goonies. The high school sweetheart, Meridith, looks 27 years old and the actress (Jane Levy) had real trouble focussing on Creech and looked a bit vacant at times which was distracting. Even Rob Lowe and a pleasant surprise appearance by a favourite of mine, Barry Pepper, couldn't save this one for me.How Will The Kids Find It?Well, this is where my junior reporter Emir Yasemin comes in. Here are his thoughts on the Monster Trucks movie, which are far more important than my own.@duffythewriter monster trucks reviewWhat did you think of the family screening day? Were there things to do?I have noticed one activity which was colouring in and there was free drinks and popcorn.Have you heard of Monster Trucks before seeing the movie?Yes on commercials and I wanted to see this movieWhat is Monster Trucks about?A young man discovers a creature at his workplace, they become friends. A company wants to kill the creature and the young man tries to save himWhat are the best bits?The chase and the creature in the carWhat would make Monster Trucks better?More information about Creech more action and racingWho should go and see Monster Trucks?I've told my friends to watch this movieWhat's your score?Eight out of ten.Monster Trucks is in cinemas now rated PG. A pleasant way to while away a Sunday arvo if you have a bunch of eight and under kids to entertain! Just don't expect much for the adults."
2,#monstertrucks is not bad if you are just looking for some laughs. Typical monster comedy. (2/5Scales)
5,"this movie was way cuter than I expected, me and my group loved it!"
5,My whole family loved this movie.
5,Our family loved it. Perfect for kids. Thought the story had a lot of originality and good message. Plot had some twists but easy for kids to understand. Our eight year old and ten year olds loved it. They laughed throughout. Family friendly and clean too.
5,i think this might be the best movie next to the new power rangers
2.5,My daughter liked it.
2,"Over a year ago, I found myself scrolling through upcoming releases and became fascinated by a film called Monster Trucks. Without a plot synopsis, I was incredibly curious how they would pull off a film that is based around the fact that giant trucks leap over cars. Then the plot details were released, then the first trailer debuted, and then I found myself sitting in the theatre wondering why this film was ever made. It may be a harmless film for children between the ages of 4 and 10 to enjoy, but there is no way it's going to win over the parents that bring their kids or even the teenagers who like going to the monster truck events. There is a reason why this film was placed in January and here is why I believe Monster Trucks was doomed from the start.We've all seen this premise done a million times over, so what makes this interpretation so special? The answer is nothing. Tripp, a high-schooler who wants nothing more than to get away from his boring life, spends his Friday nights working at a junkyard, assembling a truck for himself. After an explosion at an oil facility, a creature escapes, wreaking havoc on the surrounding areas. Eventually finding a home under the hood of Tripp's truck, it becomes the engine he needs to power the truck, as well as an unlikely friend, whom also allows itself to be an icebreaker between Tripp and his friend Meredith. Sound silly? That's because it is. Due to the fact that this film is done with care and tries very hard to impress the younger demographic, it's extremely hard to criticize. Having said that, Monster Trucks really isn't that good of a film.From loud-mouthed bullies that are solely there to make our main character seem smaller, to generic plot devices like an absent father, to wanting to be his own man and prove he is worthy to the sheriff, there are so many laughable elements to Monster Trucks, and yet it plays out as if it doesn't even realize it clearly has these issues. The fact that every single scene is practically hiding a flaw makes this film look like a joke as a final product. Having said that, most young children will not have a clue that they have seen stories like this before, because it just embraces it. That is why this film is solely for children. I honestly feel that I would have loved this film if I had been a five year old sitting in the theatre. Also, there is one particular scene that bugged me. When the truck drives itself through the town for the first time in classic monster truck fashion, it drives over and crushes about 20 cars at dealership, and not a single person comes after them. Logic was completely out the window on that one.It should come as no surprise that trailers show far too much when it comes to any big-budget studio film that over-markets itself. Having said that, the trailers for Monster Trucks are some of the worst I have seen in a long time, due to the fact that it hides any slow moments and focusses completely on the action sequences. I think every single action scene was shown almost from beginning to end throughout the trailers, probably because the studio needed to showcase the ""monster truck"" element as much as they could. The studio themselves came out a couple months ago, stating that they whole-heartedly believed this film would be a failure. Well, if the opening weekend numbers are any indication, then an $11,000,000.00 haul for a film that cost the studio $125,000,000.00 should definitely be a wake-up call.In the end, I can't deny that this film tried its very best in making a competent picture, aiming itself at a very young demographic, but since it focussed so heavily on pleasing kids, there is not enough substance for adults to connect with. Sadly, there is more substance in Pixar films, due to the fact that they are children's films, aimed at all ages, helming extremely powerful stories. Monster Trucks squanders any promise it has and even though there is some clear effort put into the making of this film, there is not much to commend in the end. Overall, Monster Trucks boasts a few likeable characters, impressive visuals for what they are, and kids can have a blast with the action scenes and cute creatures, but as a film, it's just not very good. I admired the effort, but it's a flop in many more ways than one."
2,"""Kids will likely enjoy it, but I'm not even gonna remember this movie by the end of the month. Hell, I'm honestly having trouble remembering it right now."""
2,"Bland leads, confused plot, haphazard direction.But, hey, the monster is cute!"
1.5,Okay film is funny for kids.
5,Awesome movie. My children wife mom and step dad all enjoyed it. I can't see why it has a low rating.
1,Horrible..My 5 yr old thought it was OK but it was difficult to sit through
4,"What a cute movie. The theater was full, I wasn't expecting that but it was endearing, sweet, something everyone would love to be a part of, being a hero."
2,My 7 and 5 year old said it was the greatest movie ever and they want it on DVD for me...? I had a couple chuckles but honestly felt like going to sleep through the movie. I pay for 4 tickets and when I go to see a movie I try to pay the most attention to get the most for my money but I felt I wasted my money on this one. I feel the target age is 5-10.
3.5,"It was an enjoyable, not good or bad, just enjoyable. I recommend for kids whom liked E.T or Earth to Echo"
5,My 7 year old boy says that this movie is now his all time favorite movie
5,"Monster Trucks has a beautiful, elegant simplicity to it. It is a beacon of brilliance in film, and all artists and storytellers should look to it for guidance. No, I'm not kidding.Maybe it's just because a lot of dull and poorly-made movies have come out lately, but Monster Trucks blew me away by being so much better than I thought it would be. It has a sensible plot, likable and believable characters, arcs with payoff, foreshadowing, a fantastic cast, and so much more.It's convinced me that it must be harder to make a bad movie than a good one. It begins with a simple premise: what if monster trucks were actually trucks with monsters in them? Then, everything in the movie builds off of or supports that premise. It was carefully thought-out, and it has heart, and it has some seriously awesome action sequences. Everything was meticulously planned, from the tiny brick jokes to the actually important plot stuff.It sounds like sarcasm, but I would easily put Monster Trucks in my top 10 movies of all time if I knew what the other movies on that list were. For me, it beats out any of the big movies recently, like Rogue One or Passengers, and even movies I really liked, like La La Land or Hidden Figures.It's not getting the attention it deserves. Seriously, people, it has monsters, trucks, monsters in trucks, monster trucks, and monsters in monster trucks. And best of all, it makes all of that MAKE SENSE! And be funny! And even maybe make you cry a little bit at the end! What more could you possibly want?!"
5,Loved the story. For a movie written by a four year old it was surprisingly good. I would recommend it to a kid form 7-10
5,My favorite film of all time
3,"Monster TrucksInitial Reaction: A movie about trucks that become monsters or monsters that become trucks?Main Characters Tripp: He's a worker at a junkyard. He's played by Lucas Till.Plot Sumary When an oil company searches through the earth for the next stash of oil, they run into a huge batch of water. When they try to punch through it, they find that it is inhabited by squid like creatures. One of the creatures manages to escape while two others get caught by the company. The escaped squid creature hides in a junkyard and is found by Tripp. They have a bit of a rough first impression, but it's not long before the creature and Tripp become friends. That's when Tripp finds out that these creatures drink oil instead of water and they can be used as engines for large trucks. Tripp outfits one such truck with his squid pal, and they are off. But when several guys from the oil company shows up at Tripp's door to find the missing squid creature, it gives him reason to help that squid creature find the other two creatures and set all of them free.SCORINGMain Characters Trip is really good as a guy who just wants to do the right thing. And he has great chemistry with the squid creature. SCORE: 9Supporting Cast There's the leading lady who's there to be the ""his girlfriend but not his girlfriend"", a bunch of standard bad guys and the father figure who for some reason isn't around to help out. Not a good group. SCORE: 4Plot The film starts off great with the creatures being found - and how Tripp and his squid become friends. But the climax is really convoluted and the resolution leaves a lot to be desired. SCORE: 5Originality This film feels like your average alien film; the trucks really don't add much to the mix. And it also suffers from bland bad guys and the bland leading lady. SCORE: 5Violence Factor There are a lot of trucks bashing into each other, and some of them crash. But we don't see any damaged or destroyed trucks onscreen - they just vanish as if they never existed. Not good. SCORE: 4Other Moral Issues This film does a great job of showing how two totally different creatures can learn to work as a team. SCORE: 8Final Score (Out of 60): 35 % Score: 58.33% It's got a great pair of leads, but the rest of the cast is forgettable."
5,"all the critics here are MORONS. Monster Trucks is a superior film, i touched myself the entire time i was in the theatre. Creech's performance throughout this entire film was wonderful, dare tell me that he's cgi and not a real monster and i will shank you next time i confront you in the back alley of the local krogers. not all heroes wear capes, and in the case of monster trucks, my hero wears an entire fucking truck on its body. fuck yeah, mothertruckin' monster trucks."
1.5,"Other than one or funny moments, this movie was a total waste of time. I had more fun completing my tax return."
2,"When looking at a trailer for ""Monster Trucks,"" you can easily say that it looks like any other poorly made January cash grab. However, ""Monster Trucks"" will surprise audiences by being more than that. Although the over-the-top performances and the poor production value are certainly not ideal, kids should have a fun time with ""Monster Trucks."" It isn't great, but it's mediocre enough for the target audience to get behind it."
5,This is a thoroughly entertaining family movie. I brought my 12 year old son and we both enjoyed it equally. Ignore the cynical critic on this one. It's the kind of film that I loved as a kid because it has that good hearted center of classic story telling that is painfully missing in today's movies. Go see for yourself and enjoy the ride.
5,if u have kids its great for them.!

One thing that really bothered me about the film was the first act. It wasn't slow, but the characters were so dumb that it was hard to feel for them in their situations. The camera work was also pretty questionable, but everything (for the most part) is just mediocre enough that the target audience won't seem to care."
2,Fast & Furious+Free Willy+Mcgiver+Pokemon?? lol
5,It was actually good! I had many laughs and 7years old kid loved it!
1.5,An absolute destruction of a film. Overall Rating 5.7/10
4,A fun original movie that all audiences will enjoy and has a few subtle political and environmental messages up its sleeve as we head into a weird time.

5,"Me encanto,,mucha accion,,muy tierna,,mucha aventura..genial para toda la familia,,mucho mejor q en trailer.."
5,"an absurd, but fun family movie, loved it!"
5,"My son and his friend LOVED it. In fact, he exclaimed, ""That was awesome!"" on more than two occasions. I imagine he is in a better place to judge a movie made for kids than an adult critic."
5,"The same folks that said Home Alone was 1-star, because it didn't have the depth of the Godfather are the same folks telling you this movie has no audience. This is a great film geared towards kids 12 and under that can be enjoyed by the whole family. Just went with three families - 10 of us total - and everyone enjoyed it (from age 3-60). If you have young boys, they will love it."
4,"It was actually (shockingly) a pretty good story, even though it was a little cheesy in parts. My 8 year old loved it, my 12 year old thought it was pretty good. My wife and I were both assuming it was going to be awful. Not a must see but not as bad as the ratings here."
3,"Time will tell, but Monster Trucks just might qualify as the strangest movie I see this year. For one, the film is a big budget production that has apparently found itself in a battle against its own idea. Letting the idea of a monster that inhabits a truck apparently makes for good internet fodder (even if it was only going off the trailer). This likely led to the film only bringing in 10 million over the weekend (for a film that cost close to 200 million to make). Secondly, word on the street is that the film was originally being written for a slightly older crowd. Forecasting the challenge of the internet fodder pushed it back onto the editing floor in efforts to reformat its core audience. This ended up tweaking the story a bit younger than intended. All of this has led to a film that tries to be a number of things all at the same time. Having seen the film, I must say, they actually do a decent job at explaining the whole idea of the monster in the truck. If there was a way for them to make the whole concept make sense (pratically), they managed to find a way, and it keeps the film from becoming cheesy.It is still, however, a film about a monster in a truck, and there were a number of ways they could approach the story behind the concept. After moving us through a very quick sequence of events that bring the monster into play, we are introduced to the main character (Tripp) who is presented as a young senior trying to navigate a broken home and difficult social life (alcoholic and absent father, outcast at school). These opening scenes are quite good, and open the door to approach the film in a more serious manner (kind of like they did with Pete's Dragon). But then we veer into some sequences that feel more like a film that intends to approach the concept in a more over the top, fun and ridiculous manner. More of a satire and farce than a serious story. This back and forth follows the film throughout, moving from the action sequences to the more serious subject matter (which moves from Tripp to a message about environmentalism). It gives the entire film a weird and loopy feel that left me uncertain about what kind of film it really wanted to be. And here's the thing: the on-screen monster (which is not really a monster) looks quite good, and the film spends a good deal of time giving us some nice close up shots of the monster's detail. But this attention to detail mixes a weirdly compelling gross factor with the sweetness that story brings out of the creature. It's a rather confusing mix of emotion. And this is not to mention it is a film about environmental consciousness that is also about a gas guzzling truck. But hey, that should reach both crowds right?The film is a mix of old school 80's films, throwing in a little bit of E.T. and A Never Ending Story with a bit of Pete the Dragon and Herbie. If that makes any sense you are further along than I am in understanding Monster Trucks. And to be honest, I could see my 8-10 year old self loving this film back in the 80's. As an adult, I must admit that it succeeded in taking me back to my 8 year old self. There is a cohesive story, and the seriousness of the opening sequence gives it just enough to carry through some of the hodge podge of tones, just enough to enjoy the heart behind the monster-Tripp relationship, even as we are laughing at the more satirical parts of the film in the next scene (I hope Jane Levy's character was intended as a satire, because I laughed every time she was on the screen). I think if you choose not to take the film too seriously, but allow yourself to fall for the weirdly charming monster, you might get this film. If you are free to yell ""come on Macgyver"", and still care enough to say ""awe"" when Tripp says ""you are a good monster"", you might enjoy the film. And your experience might depend on the company you watch it with. It is a film that I think our son would have really liked two years ago. He simply enjoyed it at 15. I enjoyed it because I was able to allow myself to shed a few years off of myself at the same time."
3.5,My daughter really enjoyed this movie. It was the first time she has gone to a non animated film in the theaters so I was not sure how she'd like it. It had just enough CGI and action to keep her thoroughly entertained throughout the whole film.
4,Great Movie! Kids really enjoyed it! Don't pay attention to the nay-saying critics. It's a fun fictional movie!
4.5,My 5 year old and I thought it was very entertaining. Kept his attention and mine from start to finish.
4,"Read a lot of terrible reviews about this movie, but in a somewhat telling situation my four-almost-five-year-old boy BEGGED us to take him, so we did. Sure, Rolling Stone and the LA Times thought it was crap, but I suspect if they had been four year old boys reviewing it they would have given it four stars, as I am, on behalf of my boy. The story is cute and simple. The trucks are...monster-ish. The monster is actually pretty cute. There are no curse words or violence. No sarcasm or cynicism. Just a cute story about monsters and trucks. What more could a little kid ask for?"
3,"Um, did you expect a masterpiece? An academy award contender? A science fiction epic? You did expect a Nickelodeon style children's movie, right??Okay, go into to movie expecting it to be what it was intended to be.This is a pretty good children's movie, albeit a little bit misguided in its message but that is commonplace. It's fun, the effects are quite good, it has good humor, and a sweet message about family. It's certainly being misrepresented by some critics and moviegoers. I overheard a fellow claim that it only made $3 million on opening weekend.... but it did well over 3 times that figure. I hope that it does better than most are expecting. If you missed it because you thought it would be awful, especially if your children are interested by the commercials, I recommend that you give it a shot. And I'm not a big custom truck type of guy. ;) Have fun.Oh! I forgot to mention this: Monster Trucks has perhaps the best usage of the Wilhelm Scream that I have ever experienced!! Watch the movie just for that!"
3.5,this a funny heart-warming good family film enjoyed it very much look forward to seeing other movies like this
4.5,My boys (8 & 10) and me enjoyed the movie and look forward to seeing it again.
2,stupidly impractical!! well the previous tell you that! some very well known/great actors... not the main character. but if you want your young ones mesmerized for around an hour... pop this on and go have yourself a drink!
5,Our whole family loved this movie! A lot of fun.
5,"Just got done watching this movie with my family... I'm not sure I understand what the critics expect but this movie was good and wholesome. It had a good story line,no language,and had morals for a change.I would recommend this to anyone who wants a change from the vulgarity that Hollywood usually puts out."
0.5,"I don't know who signed up for this piece of garbage when the idea was pitched sound some conference table, but, apparently they think.anything they throw together no matter how ridiculous, ignorant, far fetched, etc people will accept as valid entertainment.They're right."
2.5,"170114: Two eleven-year-old boys raved about this film. Their 50 year old escort not so much. Jane Levy reminded me of Lindsay Lohan and the film made me think of Disney. Monster Trucks is basically a two-hour commercial for Dodge with some pretty bad acting. In regards to the special effects, the creatures did not inspire much but their integration into the vehicles was pretty damn neat. Unfortunately, I will not likely ever seek this film out again."
2.5,"While the story was predictible and the characters are bland. the concept is similar to films like fast and furious and how to train your dragon. But however the jokes are pretty decent. With lack of better way of saying it, i feel like it....came out at a wierd time. It is enjoyible to children and i highly recommend it but for 5-12 year olds adults and teens watch just for laughs. Its a okay movie"
3.5,"Are you a sci-fi nerd? Are you a gear-head? Well this film caters to both of ya!MONSTER TRUCKS.So the plot consists of a few elements we've seen before: the hidden pet, the big bad corporations trying to destroy the alien/magical creatures, the standard teen movie drama (although toned down for kids). But honestly, it worked, it didn't break new ground or anything, but it wasn't unwatchable, the plot flow felt pretty organic, nothing really felt out of place.Visually, it was amazing! The landscape shots were a feast for the eyes, the town felt like a real place, & the car chases were about as action packed & nail-biting as a PG movie can get, which were better than you'd think.The creatures were really well done, they moved as if they had actual weight, & looked about as real as they could. Their design was...what I think H.P. Lovecraft would think up if he was tasked with making a lovable kids' character; but at the same time, they followed a pretty plausible biological path, even calling into question some of our old legends.The cast was pretty decent, our main guy was multilayered & relatable. Jane Levy is always a delight to watch; as our main girl, she's kind've subdued, I felt as if she was fighting to hold back her performance. Of course, this did help me see her as an awkward smart girl coming out of her shell, so it all worked out. The supporting characters truly lived up to their roles, helping the heroes move the story along. The villains were a mixed bag: you got your soulless business man, your intelligent but brutal enforcer, your good-to-bad turncoat, your bad-to-good turncoat, bottom line, they played their parts well, & I could tell that the actors were putting in some real effort, even though it's a kids movie.3 & 1/2 stars out of 5, if you have a family, if you love machinery, if you are not totally sick of environmental messages, this film is worth seeing. Now this begs the question: will we ever get a crossover with Pete's Dragon? Only time will tell..."
3.5,"It was a pretty decent, very fun and very cute live-action/animated family action comedy adventure. It had very well done animation, really nice cast, nice characters, really fun action, really exciting adventure, good humor, really great music, really nice cinematography and an interesting plot. This one is not as good as ""The Goonies,"" ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,"" ""Cars"" movies, ""Herbie the Love Bug"" movies, and ""Super 8."" I would recommend this movie who really likes the ""Monster Jam"" stuff."
5,Great movie for kids!
5,"This was a very cute movie! My husband, 12 year old, and I really enjoyed it!"
5,"The critics are way wrong on this one, its an instant classic!"
5,"I really liked it , and my favorite Actor was awesome. If it's on DVD I want to buy it !!!!!!"
5,"This review is thru the lens of the target audience...kids. We saw this movie on opening night, and counting our 5, there were 9 people in the movie. I understand this will be a dud at the box office. However, the movie entertained our kids and everyone in the theater. It is a fun concept and a fun movie for the whole family, in a time where kids toys are made into uber violent movies they will never see (hello current DC comics genre).If you have kids that like trucks and movies with kids as the heroes, go see this movie. Screw the critics. If you like the previews, that is exactly what you are going to get with this movie.There is an ""eco message"" that is overwhelmingly overt, but your kids will not be affected by it. It is simply a fun, feel good movie."
5,I really like the movie
1,"I hope the SEC is planning to investigate the $115M writedown Paramount/Viacom took on this film. I think that this movie might just be an enormous scam or some kind of insurance fraud. This movie supposedly cost $125M to make. That's a lot of money. $15M more in fact than it cost Sony to make Passengers which starred Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt in a Dubai hotel floating through space. This movie stars Lucas Till as Tripp, Jane Levy as girl, and Dodge logo as a Dodge logo brought to you by Dodge. There is no way that this steaming pile cost $125M to make. That's 2 and a half times the budget of Arrival which again had to pay real actors with real name recognition. This looks like a $50M film max so I'm just curious about what they spend the other $75M on. Maybe they spent it on the rights to film on location at an actual Dodge dealership for literally 20 minutes of the movie. The movie itself was full of flat characters meandering their way through the disjointed plot. Overall it was utterly forgettable which is the absolute worst thing a movie about trucks full of octopi can possibly be."
0.5,Shouldn't this be called Monster IN THE Truck?
5,"I can't believe that the critics didn't like this movie. My boys 8 & 9 LOVED it and I thought it was funny and totally family friendly. Kid movies should be fantastical and cheesy! Our children get enough reality, and I don't think they made it to get the best Drama Oscar."
4,my grandkids loved the movie she wants it when it comes out on DVD
2,"Ok for kids under 10, but very weak for young kids and adults. Very slow and boring. A lot of trucks and no real truck action. Just a lot of talking and talking."
1.5,The movie was Born ing and dumb and predictable
3.5,"This was actually a fun family movie. Don't expect it to be perfect, & yes it is predictable, but Creech was cute & the action was fun."
4,Fun movie. Very enjoyable. Nothing new though. Save the environment. Beat the bad guy.
1.5,"Though a creative idea that will surely get the kids excited, Monster Trucks suffers from poor characterization and strangely boring car chases."
3,Easy to watch film for a rainy Sunday afternoon with the kids
2,"While it has a few imaginative moments, Monster Trucks crashes and burns with a recycled story, forgettable characters, really dated CGI, and incredibly forced humor, it's a film that reeks of Diesel and low thought!"
0,Whoever came up with this movie must've been on some serious hardcore drugs.
5,A good story about people that come together to do the right thing. My family loved it. Ignore the critics.
4,"My grandson loved it, it's for kids. Don't get wrapped up in the plot just enjoy the action"
4,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie but I have to say as an adult I really enjoyed it. In addition, the other mom and five kids (girls and boys) I went with loved the movie. I would much rather see it again than ""Sing"" which we thought was a little boring other than the end song sequence. Monster Trucks is just over two hours long but we felt it went by really fast. The action was nonstop and held our attention the whole time. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking to fill an afternoon with the kids."
4,people clapping at the end. bad reviews. nice kids movie
3.5,"A really stupid movie. But with that being said, it was definitely fun to watch. It has several good funny bits, and the monsters were very well done."
2,Pretty bad didn't like it.
5,Once again I love it when people give reviews without seeing a movie just to post something. We just saw the movie and the audience was full of parents with and without kids. The whole audience was laughing and cheering. Just a fun feel good movie and will see it again. Just good fun family fil for a change....no wonder critics paned it.
3,"Monster Trucks is a cheesy, cute, and yet ridiculous of a family film about a Mediterranean creature that can hide and control a truck. And consumes oil. The idea and concept is beyond ridiculous but I am sure kids will enjoy it. And adults will either find the movie cute or stupid. It is no E.T. but does try for that formula with a high school teen Tripp (Lucas Till) that is desperate to move away far from home. Dislikes his mother new boyfriend and a Sheriff Rick (Barry Pepper). Tripp works in a junkyard at night until he finds a slimy tentacle creature that loves to consume oil and can maneuver his way around a truck. After an accident, when a corporation that was drilling for oil discovers an underground pocket that unleashed this creature. Reece (Rob Lowe) in charge of this oil company sends his security to hunt the creature down. Tripp and his classmate Meredith (Jane Levy) are on a chase to get away from the bad guys and to help the creature escape them. I will say the film is cute, to see a friendly creature that Tripp tries to help. From the moments of him trying to customize his truck for it to fit in and so he can have full control of the truck with Tripp and Meredith being the passengers in a crazy ride. Especially, when they are being in a car chase with henchmen Burke (Holt McCallany) and his team. Being in a car chase in a small town can be ridiculous with the creature able to have the truck leap onto walls and rooftops. Director Chris Wedge made this chase seem like he was playing around with toy trucks and using his imagination on some ridiculous action scenes. It is a family film that tries to be all heart and cheesy fun for the kids. Otherwise, if you are looking into serious acting and well written script. Well you can cross that out with this film not aiming for that direction. The acting was decent. Lucas Till performance was forgettable and Jane Levy was okay as an awkward teen. Amy Ryan as Tripp's mother was almost forgotten with her small role. Rob Lowe was difficult to take seriously. Barry Pepper as an obsessed with his car Sheriff was entertaining. The visual effects were decent as well, and moments were you could point out when characters were standing or hanging above a green screen. Director Chris Wedge has done some previous work like animation films like Epic and Ice Age. He can create some cute characters that can win the audience. He tries here with the creature that is cute and all but it does not make it a worthy film. Or a memorable one. Like I said before, kids will have a better enjoyment out of this one and parents will have a split opinion. Monster Trucks is a fair family film that has a redundant plot, cute concept, and dull acting."
4.5,Much better than I had anticipated. Solid storyline for the most part. Good humor.
5,Funny and entertaining with good morals.
5,"Was fantastic, really drew you into it...the creature was just so cute you had the love it and you were really pulling for them it was just a very cute very nice movie and this 74 year old person loved it"

1,"My god was it bad. Don't go see this unless you want to cringe hard. The ""characters"" are paper thin and well what can I see this will drop your IQ points."
2.5,"Monster Trucks is better than expected.Although the movie delivers some chuckles, the acting in this movie is absolute trash! All the 'Emotional' scenes aren't well handled and that is the fault of both the actors and the Director. Speaking of the director, Chris Wedge, Paramount lured him away from the studio he co-founded, Blue Sky Studios (Ice Age, Rio), to direct this film, was it a good move on Wedge's part, no, although Blue Sky's latest release Ice Age Collision Course is sitting at a 15% Rotten Tomatoes and only managed to rake in $64 Million at the Domestic Box Office, The Ice Age movies are huge hits in the foreign market, The foreign market helped Collision course be a success by making $408 Million worldwide total. Monster Trucks is expected to open with about $10.1 Million and end its run with $22 Million (Domestic), If that ends up being true Paramount Pictures will loose $115 Million! To Monster Trucks' credit they got me to fall in love with Creeth, Yes the CG used to bring Creeth to life is horribly done, his personality was the best thing about this movie, he provided humour and heart! The car chases in this film are also well done, they are thrilling and extremely fun to watch. Overall Monster Trucks is a hot mess, with horrible acting, lousy camerawork and decent humour.5/1050%""C-""Should You See It? If you want to go out and see a movie with your kids then... Go see Sing, but if you have already seen it then this is good too, also a good movie to stream to distract your kids.-Yousef Al-Waeli"
4,"This is a good movie for small kids who enjoy science. It gives elements of engineering, biology, chemistry, archeology, and environmental preservation. It starts off a bit slow and doesn't build the characters so well, but it had my nephew and the other kids in the theater cheering. Their happiness is what counts the most."

This film is okay, it's a cool action flick for children, the script is a bit laughable and its obvious when watching that the actors featured in 'Monster Trucks' are genuinely struggling to deliver their lines. Overall though, the action is fun and I think this film works well for the very young audience its targeting."

1,"The entire film could have existed with the first love story and ended with Gertrude traveling to live in the love she lost. The story's purpose lost its path and felt like an endless walk in the desert. At the start of the film, Gertrude is defined by her intelligence and stubbornness to simply not settle for anything in life. Once in a foreign land she lost that in her curiosity and love for Henry, who truly seemed to be her equal. Once he was lost, the men only treated her as an equal to fall in love with her and she let them. It flawed her character.The use of time throughout the film was not consistent and the audience was left to create a randomly paced timeline in their head only to be thrown off by the confusing use of both months and dates leaving an unrealistic sense of time. The film does not end back at its flashback of a start to complete the story's circle in order to explain the importance of her journey. Instead Gertrude, in a very classic fashion, rides off into the sunset as the title of the film finally is explained."

The film does not end back at its flashback of a start to complete the story's circle in order to explain the importance of her journey. Instead Gertrude, in a very classic fashion, rides off into the sunset as the title of the film finally is explained."

1,So incredibly boring.
2.5,"A frustrating biopic that lacks in consistency and real sense of purpose or direction, as it remains unfortunately nothing more than a reverential story that suffers even more from a complete absence of chemistry between Gertrude/Kidman and both her lovers."
1,An example of the boring dung I have to watch because of my love for The Franco and The Kidman...
4,"Don't know why all the bad reviews...I thought this was true to form, a gorgeously shot and elegantly directed biopic that captures the beauty of the desert and the nostalgia of the orient. Bravo Werner!"
3.5,"The cinematography in this film was just beautiful, but although the actors did well with their performances, the script just let them and the whole movie down--there was no dramatic build up and the end of the film seemed very abrupt. That said, I did enjoy it for the scenic views and Robert Pattinson's Lawrence, which was rather refreshingly different from Peter O'Toole's very emotive, brooding hero. Instead, here we have a brash full-of-himself young man. Glad I saw it, but once was enough."
2.5,"The woman who knew every inch of the middle-east!It is a kind of female version of 'Lawrence of Arabia', the lead actress herself told that. A biographical drama of a British woman who had played an important role in many middle-eastern affairs during the early 1900s. After the tragic death of the man she was madly in love, the young Gertrude Bell decides to travel across the middle-east to write about it and to do some archaeological research and other stuffs. After the decades of travel on all the corners of the region, what she achieved was the film disclosed in an inspiring way.I love this director's films and filmmaking style. It is his first time since last 6 years, but not good as I expected. It is a bit of both, documentary and feature film. Awesomely shot, I loved the camera work and actors too did so well. Nicole Kidman was brilliant, might be her best for portraying in a real life character. Yet something was missing from the film. Maybe the film came at the wrong time, should have been made at least 15 years ago. Otherwise, it is an Oscar worthy product.This film is worth watching for the beautiful desert landscapes and obviously for Kidman. The issue with the story is the focus which completely relied on Kidman's role. She was everywhere and leaving blank on the other end. Something like showing what she accomplished was the notion, so in perspective, it could have made a better documentary film. Some people might like it, especially if you're from the middle-east. But don't expect I would recommend it, because I won't. Whatever I said the film was not bad, just a 50-50 kind.5/10"
3.5,"an intentional veil of the feminine Kidman over the vast desert and political climate in uncertain times. Unfortunately, this ""queen"" was portrayed as a lovelorn, almost bratty lass."
0,"Unbelievable failure considering not only the talent involved but the fascinating woman and times that this flop is based on. Where to begin? Nicole Kidman as a young Oxford graduate, photographed in such soft focus that one is compelled to find her wrinkles? Examine her wig? Only until James Franco appears on screen ... with an English accent so feeble and a lack of charisma so strong that one is actually fascinated by this odd choice by Werner Herzog.The phony chemistry between tall and imposing Kidman and Franco is as laughable as the background music, which does not know when to stop.Damian Lewis and the other British actors are fine, as usual. Kidman has copied a few bad habits from Meryl Streep - who would have been cast in the main role had this film come to life decades earlier - loud sighing, heavy breathing and barking when angry. Read Gertrude Bell's biography instead."
3,Better than the critics (who have given mainly negative reviews) say it is. I found learning about this rather amazing woman very interesting and informative. Nicole Kidman does a pretty good job of Gertrude Bell with reasonable supporting actors. The story could have delved into the Bell's motivations a bit more and with a bit more tension. But it is an adequate movie and worth seeing.
0,I saw this on the plane and thought it a good movie. Nicole Kidman has never looked better and the cinematographer and lighting crew did a top notch job on what must have been a typically challenging Herzog shoot. The pacing was a little soft for our hyper kinetic times but the characters needed to breathe so it's good that the director told a story instead of pandering to whims. Well worth a watch
1,One of our greats has lost his stature of late. Who would have thought such a creative man could desert us so.
5,Saw this movie and it added to my knowledge of how the Britished screwed up the Middle East. The acting wasn't bad though it makes Gertrude a bit more heroic then in reality. A must see for any T.E. Lawrence fan.
1,Shallow and does not give justice to Miss Bell the Iron Lady that had a key influence on shaping the Arab states of the Fertile Crescent.

3,"its not that bad of a biopic, really. Not Wener Herzog's best, but definitely not as bad as the critics make it --that is, if you can make past James Franco's happy demise in the film. Why Herzog cast Franco I do not know -- he's just horrid and with the bad British accent and smarmy personality I can see why people hated this film. Glad he croaked early and may he never do another film ever again."

4,"A woman with a passion for the desert and its peoples, who helped shape the modern Middle East. She deeply respected the people she studied and was fearless; she got to know the desert peoples when no other Westerner did except T.E. Lawrence. Exciting drama."
3.5,Saw a screening of the movie. I thought it was pretty good. It moves a little slow but the story was compelling and the scenery beautiful.
1,"I saw Queen of the Desert's premiere at the Berlinale. It's a huge disappointment, hard to believe Werner Herzog made it. I also can't believe it was submitted for the Golden Bear! What could've been a very interesting portrait of a fascinating historically important woman is actually turned into a cliché ridden incredibly schmaltzy love story with little or no chemistry between Nicole Kidman and her two male leads, a badly miscast James Franco and stiff upper-lipped Damien Lewis. There is a bit of comedic chemistry between Kidman and Robert Pattinson, who frankly looks ridiculous trying to portray T.E. Lawrence and seems to realise this by playing Lawrence as someone who doesn't take himself or life at all too seriously. The soundtrack is as cheesy as it gets, like a bad parody of 60's and 70's epic soundtracks complete with Hollywoodised 'ethnic' bits. Maybe the movie will appeal to people who like Downton Abbey, but it's just so dull it's hard to imagine. Nicole does her best with a very poor script. There's a few funny lines here and there, but it's really a huge disappointment from what could have been a great epic. Exception must be made for the arabic actors involved who act with great dignity in bit parts and Mark Lewis Jones who has an all too brief but entertaining cameo as Bell's Uncle Frank Lascelles. Overall though this movie is a dud that might be renamed Queen of the Deserted Cinemas if it isn't sent straight to DVD."
0,"Gertrude Bell was the BAMF-est archaeologist to ever pick up a spade. Indiana Jones WISHED he could have been Gertrude Bell, but sadly, truth is sometimes just plain better than fiction. I have no idea if this movie will really bring out her awesomeness, but with Werner Herzog directing, I am daring to hope. Can't wait to see it when it comes out."

2.5,Werner Herzog schafft es erstmals nicht eine plausible Geschichte zu erzählen. Der dokumentarische Teil überwiegt und funktioniert. Toll fotografiert. Inhaltlich sehr lau.
1.5,Disturbing and sad.Felt as though I was watching something I should not have been watching.
2.5,"Sadly the subject seems a lot more interesting than the film which is a pity because the concept looks rather clever but without much substantive input from the designers as to what it's based on or how it is put together the whole thing becomes a bit of a mish-mash. With the participants seemingly willing to be filmed, it's also a shame we couldn't see more of their experience, especially as in some cases it seems to have had beneficial effects."
2,''rebirth'' is a better film
3.5,"Holy crap. Not sure I would sign up for that experience, but I think it is cool. The participant interviews were probably the most interesting part (most seemed to have troubled past). Psychologists could probably tell me more of the concepts that are being used/manipulated. I wonder how much personalization and change happens on subsequent runs."

3,It was humorous at time also very racist and then in got a little worse then slightly better but that's it. Also full of stereotypes and corrupt cop that love violence. This is not a movie for kids just saying
4.5,My Kind of comedy. In this age of poor superhero movies we need anti-heros like this.
3,Funny in parts and definitely how you will be as a dodgy cop.

0,"Hilarious, quick witted, and a little sexy. I rarely want to see a movie more than once, this, I could see over and over."
5,"This is one of those films that at the start looks like the standard cop comedy movie, but as it moves along, it goes to places you wouldn't expect, has the sort of niche humour that in years to come, people will rate it as one of the great cult movies. Fantastic use of soundtrack and locations, with a plot that keeps you gripped to the end. And I laughed out loud at some of the great lines."
2.5,"It's good enough for a watch, but not a great movie....it's almost like the beginning that's needed to setup the characters was cut (or never made) and the beginning that there is does not go with the movie at all???"
1,"A bland, tasteless movie with next to no sense of where it is going. This movie is as confusing as it is utter shit. This movie is also just so hollow. There's nothing to grip you, you feel no connection to the two characters, why? Because they're goddamn assholes. There is not a single likeable trait about either of them, and trust me, I'm shocked that a movie got me to dislike Micheal Pena. And honestly what was Theo James all about, his performance was all over the place much like the plot which never goes anywhere. It's just one scene to the next with no substance or context. One second they're in the US then they're in Iceland. IT MAKES NO F*CKING SENSE! The only reason it's getting 1 star is because it at least has a few laughs, even if they are uncomfortable ones, and a some-what decent finale along with some fairly pretty looking camera work. But other than War On Everyone is total sh*t and if you want to see an awards movie about racism, do yourself a favor, and go see Hidden Figures."
4,"Skarsgard and Pena make for a weird duo but it works, this movie is well worth the $5 rent"
5,Love it!!! Good comedy/ action movie I've seen so far.
0.5,"Looks awesome but it's not, LOL."
4,"War on Everyone is a crude dark comedy that crosses many lines. It's somewhat of an homage to the cop buddy movies of the eighties and nineties, about a pair of corrupt cops who blackmail criminals and get more than they bargained for when they go up against the new kingpin in town. As crass as the movie may seem at first, it quickly develops a big heart. The entire cast is on point in performance, especially Alexander Skarsgård, who I never really had much respect for as an actor until this movie. It's a fun hilarious well crafted entertaining movie, that features my favorite type of cinematic hero, the anti-hero."
0.5,"If I could give it .001 stars I would. Despite good actors, acting was bad. script is beyond horrible along with directing and everything else. I walked out after 1 hour."
3,"Madcap shennanigans are at the forefront of this pulpy, dark police comedy. There's some great charm and interplay between the two leads; their snappy, abrasive and sardonic banter really does carry the film along. If only the screenplay was as cohesive and less contrived, then we could have had a real winning formular here. Great soundtrack though."
5,What a great movie! I have no idea why it is rated so low?!
4.5,"It was very entertaining. Funny, good action, ok plot & likeable characters."
3.5,Liked it. Goofy and funny.
5,Funniest dam movie in years! If you don't like this one then you're a stupid shit eating cunt.
1.5,"After two brilliant outings with The Guard and Calvary, all eyes were on Irish writer/director John Michael McDonagh's third feature. There's a problem though, and that problem is the same one that plagued his brother Martin when he delivered the woefully misjudged Seven Psychopaths after his successful debut, In Bruges. Martin's problem was heading straight for Hollywood while forgetting to take a coherent script with him and this film has a similar sense of deja vu. Plot: Terry Monroe (Alexander Skarsgård) and Bob Bolaño (Michael Peña) are two cops who are just as corrupt as the criminals they arrest. However, when they try and shake down a strip club owner, they stumble on an even bigger crime lord.Leaving behind the idyllic coasts of Ireland, McDonagh's third outing focuses on the sun kissed streets of L.A. where he delivers a generic buddy/cop story. He attempts to play with conventions a little by throwing in some one liners that are sure to cause offence with some minority or other but the jokes are strained and few, if any, work at all. You might think that if the humour doesn't fly then you'll find something else to grab your interest but there isn't anything. The story lacks drive and there's nothing here that we haven't seen before. In fact, most recently Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe tread the same ground with The Nice Guys with much more entertaining results. I actually felt sorry for Skarsgård and Peña; they are two gifted actors but there's no material here to work with and, together, they simply lack chemistry. There's also no attempt, whatsoever, to craft a three dimensional villain. What we get in this respect is strictly a stereotype with Theo James' upper-class, nasty attitude and posh English accent. Some vibrancy is attempted with the introduction of Caleb Landry Jones' flamboyant strip-club owner but the only colour he injects is his bright yellow socks. It's actually hard to believe that this was the same person who wrote and directed the sublime Calvary - one of my favourite films of 2014.An absolutely pointless and messy endeavour that suffers horrendously from a lazy script In fact, to quote the film itself, ""it starts and ends with the script. If you ain't got a good script, you ain't got shit"". Wise words but it's just a shame that McDonagh didn't pay heed to them.Mark Walker"

0.5,"i hated the storyline, i hated how they swore so much. i hated the nude scenes and i hate when they think those scenes are necessary to get views. what i hated the most was how they kept making fun of muslims and arabs. this movie was sick for one huge reason; they joked about how it wasn't okay to harass anyone unless they were an ARAB. Who the hell gave americans or anyone the luxury to decide if it was okay or not to harass arabs! who said anyone owned arabs or muslims or anyone?! i know hollywood and movies and actors just want to send a message through their work. if this is the message they wanted to send then hollywood and that whole cast are monsters. if they're trying to say that it's okay for them to harass arabs then they shouldn't be surprised when we actually decide to stop staying quiet. these stuff shouldn't be ignored. i don't remember arabs ever deciding whether it was fine to harass american or other people from other nationalities, but maybe we should start thinking that way. we were never violent, but i guess it is true how some of you people can be mentally ill pigs. sorry, i think i insulted pigs."
2,What did I just watch?
0.5,"The trailers are the best part of this film. This film is not funny, not well acted, but has some good cinematography. He film as a whole really disappointed me because I wanted a great film but I got nothing in return. If you thought the trailers were meh, you will hate this film, if you liked the trailers, you will be disappointed. All in all one of the biggest disappointing films."
3,This movie cracked me up. They need to take these characters and make a TV show cuz the guys are hilarious.
0.5,"the trailer is deceptive. This is billed as a comedy, yet is devoid of laughs. The opening scene has the 2 leads running over a mime & asking it the impact will make a sound. The lack of characterization makes one not care what happens on screen. The lazy direction is a waste of the casts talents. The 2 leads point out racist experiences on the police force, yet engage in racist/prejudice acts (!?!?)."
1,"This movie could have been better, if.... Michael Pena was not in it since he has statically the same facial expressions in every goddamn movie and is an incredibly dull and unfunny actor. He is catastrophic in this movie. ...if the setting was not the US, but Ireland, UK or Scandinavia, since the director is Irish and like his previous movies should have presented a European setting with badass and corrupt cops. He just could not pull off the overused American bad cop theme here. ...if Tessa Thompson's character did not exist. Was she really necessary? Her agents try hard to make her happen, it's obvious because she is very popular these days, but cannot act at all. This movie certainly did not need any romantic subplot. -....if the jokes were more clever and imaginative. They were very flat from beginning to end. I know the style of the director, which can be offensive etc., but I only laughed about two times during the whole runtime. That failed hard....if the soundtrack was diverse and other characters more interestingly and better written (they were all caricatural and I did not care for any of them)What I liked was Alexander Skarsgard's acting, since I like his works and acting in general. However, his background, lines, clothes and his godawful haircut really made him unlikeable. There was absolutely no reason for him to have a change of heart at the end. I liked the ""Blue Lagoon"" joke and how he was drinking on his own at the bar. He is a really bad dancer and has issues with romantic scenes in general since he is very stiff and often appears asexual although he arouses sexuality. I also enjoyed Stephanie Sigman, whenever she was on screen. All in all, it is a disappointing movie which I would not watch for the second time."
4,"Absurdistische komedie over de meest rampzalige politieagenten die je maar tegen zult komen werkt goed op de lachspieren, vooral dankzij John Michael McDonagh krankzinnige script en het plezierige spel tussen Pena en Skarsgard."
2,Getting awkward more than it bargained for.
3,"Note bad, not great. Some of the writing and comedy is stiff, but it's pretty entertaining. Pena needs to slow down his dialogue; too much of what he says is incoherent."
2.5,"the idea is ok, acting decent (although Bob sucks) image was ok, but the script and direction .. they dont seem to have too high of an IQ"
5,"I loved this wee Indie gem, well acted and tongue in cheek, in our politically correct world this is a f**k you to it all! It's hilarious in parts and yes smacks of Tarantino but what a compliment!Refreshing, funny and I got it!!!"
0,This is going to be cool alright.
2,"Everyone gets a mis-step, and this is John Michael McDonagh's. Sporadically funny, and drops the tantalising suggestion that Alexander Skarsgard has a hitherto unexplored flair for visual comedy, but the funnies are too few and far between and they aren't made in service of any plot or character structure worth caring about. An attempt to up the stakes and explain the vague ""organised crime"" threat late in the piece comes across as unfortunately tacky rather than just trite."
4,"The latest offering from director John Michael Donagh is an off kilter indie crime comedy.Upholding the law could not be further away from their line of duty for two wayward detectives Terry Monroe (Alexander Skarsgärd) and Bob Bolaña (Michael Peña). Drugs, blackmail, assault being just a few of their crimes as they work the Albuquerquey, New Mexico beat. But when the pair come across a dangerous crime ring run by debauched, amoral Brit James Mangan (Theo James) and his right hand man, effeminate strip club owner Birdwell (Caleb Landry Jones), they find themselves in way, way over their heads.The bad to the bones lead duo are joyously over the top and clearly had a lot of fun making the movie. Featuring gratuitous violence, language, drug use, sexy dancing and a deliciously wistful soundtrack, breaking the law has never been so funny."
4.5,"Funny, thought-provoking and violent, ""War on Everyone"" makes you laugh, cry and think. It's a clever Tarantion-like film that definitely won't be popular, but will be warmly met by people who like films with plot, likable and memorable characters, dark humour, good soundtrack and excellent cinematography."

3.5,"3.5 stars: So do you know what sound a mime-artist makes when hit by a car? This is one of the questions answered in the first 5 minuets and it also the type of black humour you get in this movie. Directed by John M McDonagh (The Guard, Calvary), with Alexander Skarsgård and Michael Peña. This (as the tagline says) is 'bad cop, worse cop' buddy movie that riffs on those 80s cop movies, such as 'Beverly Hills Cop', 'Lethal Weapon' and throwing in some Pulp Fiction pretensions. A running joke about a feud with the SWAT team... though didn't 'Hot Fuzz' do this?.. and better? It still a likeable film with some funny sequences and dialogue. Worth going to see if you get a chance, considering it's limited showings."
1,"-- WARNING! The Following is a long as balls review which could bore people to death or mildly titillate their funny bones. READER DISCRETION IS ADVISED --Starring Alexander Skarsga?rd and Michael Pen?a as two corrupt cops in New Mexico, War on Everyone tells the story of Terry Malone and Bob Bolan?o and their debauched quest to frame and blackmail every criminal insight to further their own twisted agendas be that money and/or drugs. Writer and director John Michael McDonagh has already established and proven his worth in the industry with his previous black comedic work with the cult hit The Guard and the highly acclaimed Calvary. On paper, from the sound of the story and McDonagh's reputation as a creator, this should mean that the audience is in safe hands for a good ole mean spirited romp. Think again. Right off the bat, I found that there was barely ANY redeeming factors in John Michael McDonagh's tone deaf andmuddled War On Everyone.What makes War on Everyone a war on all of my sensibilities as a fan of cinema is because of how strong, well rounded and entertaining John Michael McDonagh's previous films are. The Guard and Calvary are films that were critically well received and were featured in many top critics' favourite films of the year respective to their release. Which makes the dire quality of his latest feature a much harder pill to swallow. The plot itself is fairly cliche? with far too many unexplained coincidences garnished with a few quaint reveals here and there, but it is labored with pointless asides and jumps to scenes where characters exchange dialogue whichneither further advance plot nor character. These asides either consist of either jokes that fall flat on their face or quasi-intellectual philosophical monologues, which feel like leftover tidbits from other older scripts. One in particular consists of Terry finding a jellyfish in the middle of the desert, which looks like the setting of Breaking Bad episode ""Ozymandias"", and goes onto say how he's scared of being ""accidentally"" killed by a jellyfish. You could hear crickets chirp from 50 miles away.Nevertheless, even when the narrative is chugging along the dialogue and discourse within the film feels flat and stale. The sticking out tongue, offensive and acerbic nature of their dialogue was as shocking as it was funny, which is to say it wasn't funny or shocking at all. Instead a high level of petulance exuded off the screen, which felt as welcome as pre- pubescent body odor. I though that this fault in the script may be in part due to the context of the film itself. Take John McDonagh's brothers 2008 masterpiece In Bruges. The reason why we are in both equal parts shocked and amused by the witty black dialogue Martin McDonagh pens in In Bruges is because we are not expecting to hear such vulgar language inthe setting of a quaint European ""fairytale town"" full of tourists and families. A movie set in the United States of America on the other hand about two reprehensible corrupt cops? The history of countless police movies suggests we will hear some lewd lines and cursing. Thus the dialogue and jokes fall on death ears with not a soul laughing in their seats. What makes the dialogue worse is that you can also feel an air of smugness come across when you watch events unfold and banter arise from our ""protagonists"". You can feel that both Skarsga?rd and Pen?a believe that the lines they are spewing are just so funny and that they are just so funny for saying them.Which brings us onto another issue with the film; the casting. You can tell Skarsga?rd is attempting to shed his pretty boy persona and trying very hard to craft a ""character"" within the hour and 38 minute runtime. Unfortunately there isn't enough meat on the bones of his thinly written role for him to try something wholly original and fresh. Michael Pen?a on the other hand is Michael Pen?a and shows as much range as a discounted spatula. Pen?a himself is no stranger to the buddy cop franchise and I find him to be a pleasant and warm presence in 2012's End of Watch. But where his character in that film is balanced and realistic, his role in War on Everyone feels like a cartouche of his End of Watch counterpart. The problem in common with both Skarsga?rd and Pen?a's characters however is not that they are necessarily bad in their respective roles; it's that McDonagh reaches a hand for us to sympathise and care for their characters when they deserve anything but. Scorsese masterfully shows in Wolf of Wall Street that you can make an entertaining motion picture showcasing the scum of the world that you can enjoy from a distance because it never once asks you for sympathy for it's characters. Having said that though the chemistry between the two leads is perfectly fine. It's like their two poorly performed peas in a pod. But the biggest crime in terms of casting that the film perpetrates is thinking that general public would buy Divergent's Theo James as a genuinely threatening villain. I've seen sponges more threatening.Some pro's amidst the overwhelming cons are that at least the direction of the film is competent, chase scenes are entertaining and there is a brief random change of setting to Iceland which throws the audience completely off-guard and provides maybe the films most entertaining sequence. However I can't mask how surprised and truly disappointed I am at the way War on Everyone turned out. This is NOT the witty and clever subversion of tropes of the buddy cop genre that I had hoped for and expected from atalent such as McDonagh. Instead this is an exploitative movie that thinks far too highly of itself to take a step back and take a good look at what it is; Offensive - and not in a good way."
0.5,One of the worst films I've ever seen. Purely a commercial exercise in film making that went terribly wrong somewhere. Pained performances. Not hip. Not slick. Just boring.
0.5,"Very little to redeem this movie. Awful very limited plot, somewhat pointless. Very little humour. I suppose the quality of acting was passable. Oh dear oh dear. I guess it just didn't appeal to me. Others may get the point of it. A 50:50 user rating suggests some love it and others don't like it at all. I'm definitely in the latter camp."
0.5,only film we ever walked out of
2.5,"Basically a remake of Lethal Weapon with 2 Martin Riggs (the Mel Gibson character) updated with extra expletives and crudeness, this is entertaining enough and has its moments but is also rather cynical and disposable - the perfect example of a film where the whole is less than the sum of its parts. Frankly, the narrative comes across as unfocused and a bit all over the place but the bigger problem is the writer seems to have confused eccentricities with characterisations. So Michael Pena's cop and his wife quote philosophy to each other; Alexander Skarsgard's cop loves Glen Campbell (so that his greatest hits can be used to soundtrack the film) and Tessa Thompson's stripper is actually a cultured dancer because she reads a lot and loves MOMA. But other than that sketchy outline, you don't really know, let alone care for, these characters. It doesn't help that the big bad played by Theo James is more cartoonish than villainous. Maybe all this is just very tongue in cheek but somehow I had hoped, after the wonderful The Guard and the more thoughtful (and still thrilling) Calvary, John Michael McDonagh's first 'American' film would be more than just a bunch of eccentric sub-Tarantino-esque characters running around until the vacuous and uncharacteristically redemptive Grand Guignol finale. Also: will someone please explain the title of the movie to me?"
4.5,I don't know what I just watched but it was deeply offensive.

2,"War on Everyone breaches the boundaries of political correctness and sincerity but whilst amusing, comedy of the back of racist stereotypes and cynicism is enough to question your own morals. Not funny enough to make this random movie entertaining!"
4.5,"Rather amusing movie with fair amount of humour and a kick ass sound track , Defo worth checking out"
1,"The difference with the monstrous policeman in The Guard, is that here the characters aren't ever particularly likeable. It's hard to see them suddenly changing to become heroes two thirds in; it wasn't believable.The two women partners to these cops are just one dimensional and the villain is a collage of all the evil - gangster, kiddy fiddler, and an English Lord to boot.So none of the main characters were memorable enough to stay in the mind after leaving the cinema.Not worth the money I'm , sorry to say"
5,Loved this movie. One of the best movies I have seen in a while. It showed how good can turn bad to eradicate evil. Nice partnership as always !
0.5,Laughed all the way through...that I'd actually wasted good money to see it.
0.5,"War On Everyone is an ugly, obnoxious piece of shit. I walked out halfway."
4,Loved this absolutely hilarious highly recommended viewing!!
3.5,"John Michael McDonagh's 'War on Everyone' (2016) is a darkly comical buddy cop film that hits hard on both laughs and action. Though undeniably a fairly messy ride (the plot isn't particularly thrilling for example), the zany one-liners and general off-kilter tone of 'War on Everyone' is so enjoyable, a lot of its technical shortcomings can be swept under the rug. Don't take this film seriously and you'll have a great time with it."
1,"I had the misfortune of seeing War on Everyone at one of Odeon's Screen Unseen events and it had to be one of the most excruciating cinema experiences of my life. The film mostly consists of forced one-liners, obviously improvised with smatterings of extreme violence with very little much in the way of plot. It tries to be offensive for the sake of being offensive. Tonally it's all over the place, it tries to make you feel some sort of sympathy with the lead characters, particularly Skarsgard, who plays an alcoholic, when in fact they are pretty unlikeably with no redeeming qualities.If you've seen the trailer there's a line where one of the characters says, ""If you haven't got a good script, you haven't got shit"", which seemed like it was a dig at the current slew of poor blockbusters. How wrong I was, it was obviously a self-referential comment on the film itself."
3.5,Very strange movie but it was a fun interesting comedy action.
4.5,superb with a great soundtrack ð???ð???ð???
0,Can't wait to see this movie! Alex Skarsgard is a great actor. I will certainly watch all his work
